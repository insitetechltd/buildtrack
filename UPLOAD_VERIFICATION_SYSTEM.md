# Upload Verification System

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive upload verification system that detects failed photo uploads in real-time, persists failure records across app restarts, and provides inline retry UI for users to easily recover from upload failures.

## Problem Solved

**Before:**
- Photos could fail to upload silently (network issues, missing bucket, etc.)
- Users had no way to know if uploads actually succeeded
- Failed uploads were lost - users couldn't retry
- Assignees would see missing photos with no explanation

**After:**
- Real-time verification after each upload
- Immediate feedback on success/failure
- Failed uploads tracked and displayed
- One-click retry for failed uploads
- Persistent tracking across app restarts

## Architecture

### 1. Upload Failure Store

**File**: `src/state/uploadFailureStore.ts` (NEW)

**Features:**
- Persists failed uploads to AsyncStorage
- Survives app restarts and crashes
- Tracks upload metadata and error messages
- Methods for adding, dismissing, and retrying failures

**Data Schema:**
```typescript
interface FailedUpload {
  id: string;
  taskId: string;
  fileName: string;
  fileUri: string;
  fileType: string;
  error: string;
  timestamp: string;
  retryCount: number;
  entityType: 'task-update' | 'task' | 'project';
  entityId: string;
  companyId: string;
  userId: string;
}
```

**Methods:**
- `addFailure()` - Store a failed upload
- `dismissFailure()` - Remove a failure record
- `clearFailuresForTask()` - Clear all failures for a task
- `getFailuresForTask()` - Get failures for a specific task
- `incrementRetryCount()` - Track retry attempts
- `clearAllFailures()` - Clear everything (for cleanup)

### 2. Enhanced File Upload Service

**File**: `src/api/fileUploadService.ts` (MODIFIED)

**New Features:**

#### Upload Verification Function
```typescript
async function verifyUpload(publicUrl: string): Promise<{ success: boolean; error?: string }>
```
- Makes HEAD request to verify file is accessible
- Checks HTTP status code
- Returns success/failure with error message

#### Upload with Verification
```typescript
async function uploadFileWithVerification(options): Promise<UploadResult>
```
- Uploads file to Supabase Storage
- Immediately verifies the upload
- Returns enhanced result with success flag and error details

**Upload Result:**
```typescript
interface UploadResult {
  success: boolean;
  file?: FileAttachment;
  error?: string;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced useFileUpload Hook

**File**: `src/utils/useFileUpload.ts` (MODIFIED)

**Changes:**
- Uses `uploadFileWithVerification()` for all uploads
- Tracks successful and failed uploads separately
- Stores failures in uploadFailureStore
- Returns `UploadResults` with both arrays

**New Return Type:**
```typescript
interface UploadResults {
  successful: FileAttachment[];
  failed: Array<{ fileName: string; error: string; originalFile: any }>;
}
```

**User Feedback:**
- Shows alert summary: "3 uploaded, 1 failed - you can retry them below"
- Separates successful from failed uploads
- Preserves original file data for retries

### 4. Task Update Modal UI

**File**: `src/screens/TaskDetailScreen.tsx` (MODIFIED)

**New Features:**

#### Failed Uploads Section
- Displays warning banner when uploads fail
- Shows each failed upload with:
  - File name
  - Error message
  - Retry button
  - Dismiss button

#### Success Indicators
- Green checkmark badge on successfully uploaded photos
- Clear visual distinction between success and failure

#### State Management
- `failedUploadsInSession` state tracks failures
- Cleared on modal close or successful submission
- Persists while modal is open

## User Experience

### Upload Flow

```
1. User selects 3 photos
   ↓
2. Compression (if needed)
   ↓
3. Upload each photo
   Photo 1: ✅ Success (verified)
   Photo 2: ❌ Failed (network error)
   Photo 3: ✅ Success (verified)
   ↓
4. Alert: "2 uploaded, 1 failed - you can retry them below"
   ↓
5. Update modal shows:
   - 2 successful photos with ✅ badge
   - 1 failed photo with ❌ and Retry button
```

### Retry Flow

```
1. User taps "Retry" on failed upload
   ↓
2. App re-uploads the file
   ↓
3. Verifies the upload
   ↓
4. Success:
   - Photo added to successful list with ✅
   - Removed from failed list
   - Alert: "photo.jpg uploaded successfully!"
   
   Failure:
   - Stays in failed list
   - Alert: "Retry failed - check connection"
```

## UI Design

### Successful Photos

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  ✅              ❌  │  ← Success badge, Remove button
│                     │
│   [Photo Preview]   │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Failed Upload Warning Banner

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️  2 photo(s) failed to upload           │
│     Check your connection and tap retry  │
│     below                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Failed Upload Card

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│    ❌ (Red X)       │
│                     │
├─────────────────────┤
│ photo.jpg           │
│ Network error       │
├─────────────────────┤
│   [Retry Button]    │
│   [Dismiss]         │
└─────────────────────┘
```

## Technical Implementation

### Verification Process

**How Verification Works:**
1. Upload file to Supabase Storage
2. Get public URL
3. Make HEAD request to URL
4. Check HTTP status:
   - 200-299: Success ✅
   - 400+: Failed ❌
5. Return result

**Why HEAD Request:**
- Lightweight (doesn't download file)
- Fast verification
- Confirms file is accessible
- Checks permissions

### Error Categorization

The system categorizes errors:
- **Network errors**: "Network error during upload"
- **Storage errors**: "Upload failed: Bucket not found"
- **Permission errors**: "File not accessible (HTTP 403)"
- **Server errors**: "File not accessible (HTTP 500)"

### Persistence Strategy

**Failed uploads persist across:**
- App restarts ✅
- App crashes ✅
- Background/foreground transitions ✅

**Failed uploads cleared when:**
- User successfully retries ✅
- User dismisses the failure ✅
- User submits the update ✅
- User cancels the modal ✅

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Network Failure

**Steps:**
1. Turn off WiFi/data
2. Try to upload photo
3. Should see failure immediately
4. Turn on network
5. Tap "Retry"
6. Should succeed

**Expected:**
- ❌ Failure detected immediately
- Error: "Network error during upload"
- Retry succeeds after network restored

### Test Scenario 2: Missing Bucket

**Steps:**
1. Ensure `buildtrack-files` bucket doesn't exist
2. Try to upload photo
3. Should see failure

**Expected:**
- ❌ Failure: "Upload failed: Bucket not found"
- Retry fails until bucket is created
- After creating bucket, retry succeeds

### Test Scenario 3: Multiple Upload Mix

**Steps:**
1. Select 5 photos
2. Turn off network halfway through
3. Some upload, some fail
4. Should see mixed results

**Expected:**
- First 2-3 photos: ✅ Success
- Remaining photos: ❌ Failed
- Alert: "3 uploaded, 2 failed"
- Both lists shown in UI

### Test Scenario 4: Retry Success

**Steps:**
1. Upload fails (network issue)
2. Fix network
3. Tap "Retry"
4. Should succeed

**Expected:**
- Photo moves from failed list to successful list
- Alert: "photo.jpg uploaded successfully!"
- Can now submit update

### Test Scenario 5: Persistence

**Steps:**
1. Upload fails
2. Close modal (don't retry)
3. Force close app
4. Reopen app
5. Open same task and update modal

**Expected:**
- Failed upload record still exists in store
- Can access it from uploadFailureStore
- (Note: Session state cleared, but persistent store has it)
