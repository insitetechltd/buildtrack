# ✅ Project Picker Bug - FIXED

## 🐛 Issue

Users reported that the app would **unexpectedly switch to a different project** without them explicitly choosing it. This would happen during:
- Background data syncs (every 3 minutes)
- Pull-to-refresh actions
- Navigating between screens
- Component re-renders

## 🔍 Root Cause Identified

The bug was in **`src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx`** lines 122-176.

The `useEffect` hook had **overly aggressive dependencies**:
```typescript
}, [user?.id, hasInitialized, userProjectCount, selectedProjectId]);
```

This caused the auto-selection logic to re-run whenever:
- `userProjectCount` changed (during data refreshes)
- `selectedProjectId` changed (even from user actions)
- Projects were synced in the background

**Result**: The app would automatically switch projects without user interaction.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Changes to `src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx`

#### 1. Added useRef to Track Initial Selection
```typescript
const hasRunInitialSelection = useRef(false);
```

#### 2. Split Logic into Two Effects

**Effect 1: Initial Project Selection (Runs Once)**
- Only runs on initial app load
- Handles auto-selection for single project users
- Restores last selected project
- Shows picker for first-time users with multiple projects
- **Key**: Uses `hasRunInitialSelection.current` to prevent re-runs

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user || !hasInitialized || hasRunInitialSelection.current) return;
  hasRunInitialSelection.current = true; // ✅ Prevents re-runs
  // ... auto-selection logic ...
}, [user?.id, hasInitialized]); // ✅ Minimal dependencies
```

**Effect 2: Selection Validation (Defensive Only)**
- Validates current selection when projects change
- Clears selection if project becomes inaccessible
- **Does NOT auto-select** a different project
- Shows picker if needed

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user || !hasInitialized || !hasRunInitialSelection.current) return;
  
  // Clear invalid selections (but never auto-switch to another project)
  if (selectedProjectId && !userProjects.some(p => p.id === selectedProjectId)) {
    setSelectedProject(null, user.id); // Defensive only
  }
}, [userProjectCount, selectedProjectId, user?.id, hasInitialized]);
```

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Buggy Behavior)
| Event | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Background sync | ❌ Could auto-switch projects |
| Pull-to-refresh | ❌ Could auto-switch projects |
| Data update | ❌ Could restore "last selected" |
| Component re-render | ❌ Could trigger auto-selection |

### After (Fixed Behavior)
| Event | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Initial app load | ✅ Auto-selects (if 1 project) or restores last |
| Background sync | ✅ Project selection stays stable |
| Pull-to-refresh | ✅ Project selection stays stable |
| Data update | ✅ Project selection stays stable |
| Component re-render | ✅ Project selection stays stable |
| Project removed | ✅ Clears selection (defensive) |

## 📋 Test Scenarios

### ✅ Scenario 1: Single Project User
1. User opens app → Auto-selects their project
2. Background sync occurs → Project stays selected
3. User refreshes → Project stays selected

### ✅ Scenario 2: Multiple Projects User
1. User opens app → Sees project picker
2. User selects "Project A"
3. Background sync occurs → "Project A" stays selected
4. User navigates to Tasks screen → "Project A" stays selected
5. User returns to Dashboard → "Project A" stays selected
6. Another background sync → "Project A" stays selected

### ✅ Scenario 3: Project Switching
1. User is viewing "Project A"
2. User manually switches to "Project B"
3. Background sync occurs → "Project B" stays selected
4. No unexpected switch back to "Project A"

### ✅ Scenario 4: Project Becomes Inaccessible
1. User is viewing "Project A"
2. Admin removes user from "Project A"
3. Selection is cleared
4. Picker shows to choose another project
5. No automatic selection of different project

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

The fix is complete and ready for QA testing. 

**How to verify the fix:**
1. Select a project in the Dashboard
2. Wait for automatic background sync (3 minutes) OR trigger pull-to-refresh
3. Verify project selection does NOT change
4. Navigate between screens (Dashboard → Tasks → Dashboard)
5. Verify project selection remains stable
6. Repeat with different user roles (admin, manager, worker)

## 📁 Files Modified

- ✅ `src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` - Fixed auto-selection logic
- 📄 `PROJECT_PICKER_BUG_ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed technical analysis
- 📄 `PICKER_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - User-friendly summary
- 📄 `PICKER_BUG_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - This document

## 🎉 Impact

This fix ensures that:
- ✅ Project selection is "sticky" - it stays selected
- ✅ Only explicit user actions change the selected project
- ✅ Background operations never trigger unexpected switches
- ✅ The app respects user intent and workflow
- ✅ Data syncs are transparent to the user

## 📝 Console Logs (for debugging)

When testing, watch for these console messages:

**Initial Selection (once per session):**
```
📊 [DashboardScreen] Initial project selection logic (one-time):
  - User: John Doe
  - User projects: 3
  - Selected: null
   → Multiple projects, no valid selection - opening picker
```

**Validation (when needed):**
```
⚠️ [DashboardScreen] User has no projects, clearing selection
⚠️ [DashboardScreen] Current project no longer accessible, clearing selection
```

**What you should NOT see:**
- ❌ Auto-selection messages during background syncs
- ❌ Project switching without user interaction
- ❌ "Restoring last selected project" during normal operation
