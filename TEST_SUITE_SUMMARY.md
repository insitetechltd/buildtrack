## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before Running Tests
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. Supabase configuration is properly mocked
3. No actual API calls are made during tests

### Test Data
- All test data uses mock IDs (e.g., `task-123`, `user-456`)
- No real data is created or modified
- Tests are completely isolated from production

### Performance
- Full test suite runs in < 30 seconds
- Individual test suites run in < 5 seconds
- Watch mode for instant feedback during development

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests not found**
```bash
# Clear Jest cache
npx jest --clearCache

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules && npm install
```

**Mock not working**
- Check jest-setup.js has the mock
- Ensure mock is declared before import

**Timeout errors**
- Increase timeout in specific tests
- Check for unresolved promises

**Coverage gaps**
- Run `npm run test:coverage`
- Check coverage/lcov-report/index.html
