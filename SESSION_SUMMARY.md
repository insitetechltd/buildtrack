2. ✅ **CreateProjectScreen** - Added image banner support with 50px height
3. ✅ **TaskDetailScreen** - Added image banner support with 50px height

5. ✅ **AdminDashboardScreen** - Added image banner support with 50px height

## 🎨 Banner Display Logic

All screens now follow this consistent pattern:

```typescript
{/* Company Banner - Image or Text */}
{(() => {
  const banner = getCompanyBanner(user.companyId);
  return banner?.imageUri ? (
    <Image
      source={{ uri: banner.imageUri }}
      style={{ width: '100%', height: 50 }}
      resizeMode="cover"
      className="rounded-lg mb-2"
    />
  ) : (
    <Text style={{ fontSize: 20, fontWeight: '700' }} className="text-gray-900">
      {banner?.text || "BuildTrack"}
    </Text>
  );
})()}
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatically displays uploaded image if available
- Falls back to text banner if no image
- Consistent 50px height across screens (except DashboardScreen at 60px)
- Rounded corners for visual polish
- Cover resize mode for proper image scaling
