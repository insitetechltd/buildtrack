# iOS Simulator Scroll Guide

## Mouse Scroll as Finger Swipe

Yes! In the iOS Simulator, mouse scrolling is automatically enabled and simulates finger swiping.

## How It Works:

1. **Scroll Wheel**: Your mouse scroll wheel acts as touch gestures
   - Scroll up = Swipe down (scrolls content up)
   - Scroll down = Swipe up (scrolls content down)

2. **Trackpad**: Also works with trackpad gestures
   - Two-finger scroll = Touch swipe

3. **No Configuration Needed**: This is enabled by default in iOS Simulator

## Simulator Settings:

To verify or adjust settings:
1. Open iOS Simulator
2. Go to **Simulator** → **Preferences** (or **I/O** → **Input**)
3. Check that "Use trackpad as touch input" is enabled

## Troubleshooting:

If scrolling isn't working:
1. Make sure the simulator window has focus (click on it)
2. Try clicking on a scrollable area first
3. Check that "Use trackpad as touch input" is enabled in Simulator preferences

## Alternative Input Methods:

If you want to test actual touch gestures:
- **Click and drag**: Simulates finger swipe
- **Two-finger pinch**: Trackpad pinch gesture
- **Right-click**: Long press
- **Option + Click**: Two-finger tap
