# Photo Upload Fix - Quick Reference

## The Problem
‚ùå Photos uploaded on one device were NOT showing on other devices

## Root Causes
1. Storage bucket was **PRIVATE** (photos not accessible)
2. FAB button used old code that saved **local file paths** (not uploaded)

## The Fix (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Make Storage Bucket Public üî¥ REQUIRED
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
UPDATE storage.buckets SET public = true WHERE name = 'buildtrack-files';
```

**OR** in Supabase Dashboard:
- Storage ‚Üí buildtrack-files ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Toggle "Public bucket" ON

### Step 2: Code Already Fixed ‚úÖ
- FAB camera button now uploads to Supabase
- Photos get public URLs
- URLs saved to database
- Other devices can access photos

## Verify It Works

```bash
# Check bucket is public
node scripts/diagnose-photo-upload.js

# Check database has URLs
node scripts/check-photo-data.js
```

## Test Cross-Device

1. **Device A**: Upload photo via FAB camera button
2. **Device B**: Pull to refresh ‚Üí Open task ‚Üí See photo ‚úÖ

## Quick Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `node scripts/diagnose-photo-upload.js` | Check bucket status & recent uploads |
| `node scripts/check-photo-data.js` | Check URLs in database |
| View `SUMMARY_PHOTO_FIX.txt` | Full summary |

## Expected Console Output

When uploading:
```
üì∏ [Task Detail FAB] Taking photo from camera...
üì§ [File Upload] Starting upload...
‚úÖ [File Upload] File uploaded successfully
üîó [File Upload] Public URL generated
‚úÖ [Task Detail FAB] 1 photo(s) uploaded and ready
```

## Database Check

**Good URLs** (‚úÖ Working):
```
https://xxxxx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/buildtrack-files/company-id/task-updates/task-id/12345-photo.jpg
```

**Bad URLs** (‚ùå Old data, won't sync):
```
file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/.../photo.jpg
```
