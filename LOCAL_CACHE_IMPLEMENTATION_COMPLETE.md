# ✅ Local File Caching - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive local file caching system for BuildTrack with all core features from the MVP specification.

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### Core Services

#### 1. **CacheManager** (`src/services/cache/CacheManager.ts`)
Main coordinator for the file caching system:
- ✅ Cache files locally with SHA-256 checksums
- ✅ Retrieve cached files with integrity verification
- ✅ Get files for specific entities (tasks, projects)
- ✅ Clear cache with flexible options
- ✅ Cache statistics and monitoring
- ✅ Crash recovery on startup
- ✅ Automatic directory management

**Key Features**:
- Saves files to protected `pending/` folder before upload
- Moves to permanent cache after successful upload
- Verifies file integrity using checksums
- Recovers from crashes automatically

#### 2. **UploadQueue** (`src/services/cache/UploadQueue.ts`)
Background upload manager with retry logic:
- ✅ Queue-based upload system with priorities
- ✅ Exponential backoff retry (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s)
- ✅ Network-aware concurrency (3 WiFi, 1 cellular)
- ✅ Automatic retry when connectivity restored
- ✅ File size limits based on network type
- ✅ Upload state tracking

**Key Features**:
- Uses p-queue for concurrent upload management
- Monitors network changes with NetInfo
- Automatically queues large files on cellular for WiFi
- Resumes pending uploads after app restart

#### 3. **EvictionStrategy** (`src/services/cache/EvictionStrategy.ts`)
LRU eviction with smart protections:
- ✅ Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm
- ✅ Protects pending/uploading/failed files
- ✅ Age-based scoring (older files = higher priority)
- ✅ Size-aware eviction (larger files score higher)
- ✅ Starts at 90% (450MB), targets 80% (400MB)

**Key Features**:
- NEVER evicts files not yet uploaded
- Evicts oldest synced files first
- Frees up buffer space for new files

#### 4. **SyncManager** (`src/services/cache/SyncManager.ts`)
Realtime synchronization with Supabase:
- ✅ Supabase Realtime subscription
- ✅ Auto-download new files (< 2MB on WiFi)
- ✅ Handle INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE events
- ✅ Smart download decisions
- ✅ Metadata-only storage for large files

**Key Features**:
- Listens to `file_attachments` table changes
- Only downloads small, relevant files automatically
- Shows notifications for larger files
- Respects network type and cache space

#### 5. **CacheMetadataStore** (`src/services/cache/CacheMetadataStore.ts`)
Metadata storage and querying:
- ✅ AsyncStorage-based storage (can migrate to SQLite)
- ✅ In-memory cache for fast access
- ✅ Query by state, entity, date
- ✅ LRU tracking with lastAccessedAt
- ✅ Statistics aggregation
- ✅ Version management for migrations

**Key Features**:
- Fast queries with in-memory cache
- Persistent storage with AsyncStorage
- Ready for SQLite migration if needed

## 📊 What You Get

### Storage Structure
```
CacheDirectory/buildtrack-files/
├── pending/        ← Protected (never evicted)
│   └── [uploading files]
├── images/         ← LRU eviction
│   └── [cached images]
└── documents/      ← LRU eviction
    └── [cached documents]
```

### File Lifecycle
```
1. User selects file
2. Save to pending/ (instant)
3. Add to upload queue
4. Upload to Supabase (with retry)
5. Move to images/ or documents/
6. Available for offline access
7. Evict when space needed
```

### Upload Flow
```
local-only → uploading → synced
                ↓
             failed → (retry) → synced
```

### Network Behavior
```
WiFi:
- 3 concurrent uploads
- Auto-download files < 2MB
- Upload files up to 50MB

Cellular:
- 1 concurrent upload
- No auto-download
- Upload files up to 5MB (with warning)
- Queue larger files for WiFi

Offline:
- Save locally (always works)
- Queue for later
- Resume when online
```

## 🚀 How to Use

function MyComponent() {
  const { pickAndCacheImages, cacheStats } = useFileCache();
  
  const handleUpload = async () => {
    const files = await pickAndCacheImages({
      entityType: 'task',
      entityId: taskId,
      uploadedBy: userId,
      companyId: companyId,
    });
    
    // Files are cached and uploading in background!
  };
  
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Cache: {cacheStats?.totalSize} / 500MB</Text>
      <Button onPress={handleUpload}>Upload Photos</Button>
    </View>
  );
}
```

#### 2. Access Services Directly
```typescript
import { cacheManager, uploadQueue, syncManager } from '@/services/cache';

// Get cache stats
const stats = await cacheManager.getStats();

// Get cached file
const localPath = await cacheManager.getCachedFile(fileId);

- [ ] File encryption for sensitive documents
- [ ] Duplicate detection via checksums
- [ ] Smart pre-caching (predict user needs)
- [ ] Priority-based eviction
- [ ] Chunked uploads for large files
- [ ] Thumbnail generation
- [ ] SQLite migration for >1000 files
- [ ] Analytics and monitoring
- [ ] Export/import cache

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **iOS Background Time**
   - iOS limits background execution to ~30s
   - Large uploads may pause when app backgrounded
   - Resume when app returns to foreground

2. **Cellular Data**
   - Users on metered connections should enable "WiFi only"
   - Currently no user setting (can add)

3. **Storage Permissions**
   - Requires camera/photo library permissions
   - Must handle permission denials gracefully

4. **Cache Clearing**
   - OS can clear CacheDirectory when low on storage
   - This is expected behavior
   - Files re-download from cloud as needed

---
