## 🔄 When to Use Each Limit

### Use 5MB limit (Current) when:
- ✅ Image quality is important
- ✅ Presenting to clients
- ✅ Detailed documentation needed
- ✅ Professional appearance matters
- ✅ Storage isn't a major concern

### Use 2MB limit when:
- ⚠️ Storage is very limited
- ⚠️ Network is very slow
- ⚠️ Speed is critical
- ⚠️ Basic documentation only

### Use 10MB limit when:
- 🚫 Not recommended
- Storage costs become high
- Uploads take too long
- Better to compress to 5MB

---

## 💾 Configuration Reference

### Current Settings:
```typescript
// imageCompressionService.ts
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB
const MAX_IMAGE_WIDTH = 1920;
const MAX_IMAGE_HEIGHT = 1920;
const INITIAL_QUALITY = 0.8; // 80%
const MIN_QUALITY = 0.3; // 30%
```

### To Change Later:
```typescript
// For 2MB (more compression):
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 2 * 1024 * 1024;

// For 3MB (middle ground):
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 3 * 1024 * 1024;

// For 7MB (higher quality):
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 7 * 1024 * 1024;
```
