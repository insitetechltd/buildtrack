## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Filter Flow

```
Dashboard Button Click
    ↓
setSectionFilter(section)
setStatusFilter(status)
    ↓
onNavigateToTasks()
    ↓
ProjectsTasksScreen loads
    ↓
useEffect detects filters in store
    ↓
setLocalSectionFilter(section)
setLocalStatusFilter(status)
    ↓
Filters applied to task list
    ↓
clearSectionFilter()
clearStatusFilter()
    ↓
Banner shows: "Tasks - Section Status"
```

### Filter Store (projectFilterStore.ts)

**Supported Section Filters:**
- `"my_tasks"` - Self-assigned tasks
- `"inbox"` - Tasks assigned to me by others
- `"outbox"` - Tasks I assigned to others
- `"all"` - Combined sections (for Priority Summary)

**Supported Status Filters:**
- `"rejected"` - Rejected tasks
- `"wip"` - Work in progress
- `"done"` - Completed tasks
- `"overdue"` - Past due date
- `"received"` - Not yet accepted
- `"reviewing"` - Submitted for review
- `"assigned"` - Assigned but not accepted

### Combined "all" Section Logic

When `section="all"` is used:

**For "overdue" status:**
- Combines My Tasks overdue + Inbox overdue
- Excludes Outbox overdue

**For "wip" status:**
- Combines My Tasks WIP + Inbox WIP
- Excludes Outbox WIP

**For "done" status:**
- Combines My Tasks done + Inbox done + Outbox done
- All three sections included
