# Task Categorization Gap Analysis

## Identified Gaps

### Gap 1: My Tasks - Tasks with `accepted === false`
**Problem**: Self-assigned tasks might not be auto-accepted in all cases

**Current Logic**: 
- My Tasks includes: `(isAssignedToMe && isCreatedByMe) || (isCreatedByMe && rejected)`
- Categories filter by `accepted === true` for WIP
- **Missing**: Self-assigned tasks that haven't been auto-accepted yet

**Example Scenario**:
- Task created by me, assigned to me, but `accepted === false` (edge case)
- Currently: Falls into My Tasks but won't match any category filter
- Impact: Task appears in My Tasks total but not in any category button

**Fix Needed**: Ensure self-assigned tasks are always auto-accepted OR handle `accepted === false` case

---

### Gap 2: My Tasks - Overdue + 100% Complete Tasks
**Problem**: A task can be 100% complete AND overdue

**Current Logic**:
- `myDoneTasks`: `completionPercentage === 100 && currentStatus !== "rejected"`
- `myOverdueTasks`: `completionPercentage < 100 && isOverdue && currentStatus !== "rejected"`

**Example Scenario**:
- Task is 100% complete (`completionPercentage === 100`)
- Task is overdue (`dueDate < now`)
- Currently: Falls into "Done" category only
- Impact: Overdue status is ignored for completed tasks

**Fix Needed**: Decide if 100% + overdue should be "Done" or "Overdue" (probably "Done" is correct)

---

### Gap 3: My Tasks - Overdue + Accepted = false
**Problem**: Overdue tasks might not be accepted

**Current Logic**:
- `myOverdueTasks`: `completionPercentage < 100 && isOverdue && currentStatus !== "rejected"`
- Doesn't check `accepted` status
- **Current**: Includes overdue tasks regardless of acceptance

**Analysis**: This is likely OK - overdue tasks should show even if not accepted, but verify this matches intended behavior

---

### Gap 4: Inbox - Completed but Not Accepted Tasks
**Problem**: Task could be 100% complete but not accepted (edge case)

**Current Logic**:
- `inboxReceivedTasks`: `!accepted && currentStatus !== "rejected"`
- `inboxDoneTasks`: `completionPercentage === 100 && reviewAccepted === true`
- **Missing**: Task with `completionPercentage === 100` but `accepted === false`

**Example Scenario**:
- Task assigned to me, I completed it (`completionPercentage === 100`)
- But I never accepted it (`accepted === false`)
- Currently: Would fall into "Received" category
- Impact: Completed task showing as "Received" is confusing

**Fix Needed**: Handle 100% complete but not accepted → probably should show as "WIP" or have special handling

---

### Gap 5: Inbox - Reviewing vs Done Overlap
**Problem**: Both categories check `completionPercentage === 100`

**Current Logic**:
- `inboxReviewingTasks`: `completionPercentage === 100 && readyForReview === true && reviewAccepted !== true`
- `inboxDoneTasks`: `completionPercentage === 100 && reviewAccepted === true`

**Analysis**: ✅ No gap - these are mutually exclusive (reviewAccepted is boolean)

---

### Gap 6: Outbox - Completed but Not Accepted Tasks
**Problem**: Same as Inbox Gap 4

**Current Logic**:
- `outboxAssignedTasks`: `!accepted && currentStatus !== "rejected"`
- `outboxDoneTasks`: `completionPercentage === 100 && reviewAccepted === true`
- **Missing**: Task with `completionPercentage === 100` but `accepted === false`

**Fix Needed**: Same as Inbox Gap 4

---

### Gap 7: Tasks Excluded from All Sections
**Problem**: Tasks that don't match any section criteria

**Possible Scenarios**:
1. Task not assigned to anyone (`assignedTo` is empty)
2. Task assigned to others, not created by me, and I'm not assigned → No visibility
3. Orphaned tasks (no creator)

**Current Logic**:
- My Tasks: `(isAssignedToMe && isCreatedByMe) || (isCreatedByMe && rejected)`
- Inbox: `isAssignedToMe && !isCreatedByMe`
- Outbox: `isCreatedByMe && !isSelfAssignedOnly && !rejected`

**Missing Tasks**:
- Tasks created by me, assigned to others, BUT I'm also assigned → Shows in Outbox ✅
- Tasks not assigned to me, not created by me → Correctly excluded ✅
- Tasks with empty `assignedTo` → Need to verify they're handled

**Fix Needed**: Verify empty `assignedTo` array is handled

---

### Gap 8: WIP Categories - Edge Cases

#### My Tasks WIP:
- Current: `accepted && completionPercentage < 100 && !isOverdue && currentStatus !== "rejected"`
- **Missing**: 
  - Task with `completionPercentage === 100` but `readyForReview === false` (for Inbox/Outbox, this is WIP)
  - Task with `completionPercentage > 100` (invalid but possible)

#### Inbox/Outbox WIP:
- Current: `accepted && !isOverdue && currentStatus !== "rejected && (completionPercentage < 100 || (completionPercentage === 100 && !readyForReview))`
- ✅ Correctly handles 100% complete but not submitted

**Fix Needed**: My Tasks WIP should handle 100% complete but not submitted

---

### Gap 9: currentStatus Values Not Used in Categories
**Problem**: `currentStatus` can be "not_started", "in_progress", "rejected", "completed"

**Current Usage**:
- Only checked for "rejected" status
- "not_started", "in_progress", "completed" are ignored

**Analysis**: Categories use `completionPercentage` and `accepted` instead, which is fine, but verify consistency

---

### Gap 10: My Tasks - Accepted = false, Not Rejected
**Problem**: Self-assigned task that isn't accepted yet

**Current Logic**:
- `myWIPTasks`: Requires `accepted === true`
- **Missing**: Task in My Tasks with `accepted === false`

**Example**:
- Task created by me, assigned to me, `accepted === false`
- Falls into My Tasks but doesn't match any category
- Impact: Shows in total but not in any button

**Fix Needed**: Handle unaccepted self-assigned tasks OR ensure auto-accept always works

---

## Summary of Critical Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Impact | Fix Priority |
|-----|----------|--------|--------------|
| Gap 1 & 10: Unaccepted My Tasks | HIGH | Tasks invisible in categories | P0 |
| Gap 4 & 6: Completed but not accepted | MEDIUM | Confusing UX | P1 |
| Gap 8: My Tasks WIP missing 100% complete | MEDIUM | Inconsistent with Inbox/Outbox | P1 |
| Gap 2: Overdue + 100% complete | LOW | Probably OK as-is | P2 |
| Gap 7: Empty assignedTo | LOW | Edge case verification | P2 |

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Handle Unaccepted My Tasks
```typescript
// Add "Pending" category OR ensure auto-accept works
const myPendingTasks = myAllTasks.filter(task => 
  !task.accepted && task.currentStatus !== "rejected"
);
```

### Fix 2: My Tasks WIP Should Include 100% Complete Not Submitted
```typescript
const myWIPTasks = myAllTasks.filter(task => 
  task.accepted && 
  !isOverdue(task) &&
  task.currentStatus !== "rejected" &&
  (
    task.completionPercentage < 100 || 
    (task.completionPercentage === 100 && !task.readyForReview)
  )
);
```

### Fix 3: Handle Completed but Not Accepted
```typescript
// In Inbox/Outbox Received category, exclude 100% complete tasks
const inboxReceivedTasks = inboxAllTasks.filter(task => 
  !task.accepted && 
  task.currentStatus !== "rejected" &&
  task.completionPercentage < 100 // Add this check
);
```

### Fix 4: Verify Empty assignedTo Handling
```typescript
// Ensure empty assignedTo arrays are handled
const assignedTo = task.assignedTo || [];
// Current code already handles this ✅
```
