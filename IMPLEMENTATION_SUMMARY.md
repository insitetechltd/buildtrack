# Dev Admin Interface - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Dev Admin Screen** (`src/screens/DevAdminScreen.tsx`)
A comprehensive admin interface with:
- **User Info Display** - Shows logged-in user details
- **Active Environment Indicator** - Visual display of current database
- **Environment Switcher** - Switch between production, testing, staging, etc.
- **Add/Remove Environments** - Dynamic environment management
- **6 Testing Tools:**
  1. Generate Mock Tasks (50 tasks)
  2. Cleanup Mock Tasks
  3. Reset Database (destructive)
  4. Seed Database (sample data)
  5. Run Comprehensive Tests
  6. Database Health Check
- **Production Safety** - Red warning banner when on production
- **Loading States** - Proper UX during operations

### 2. **Database Config Store** (`src/state/databaseConfigStore.ts`)
Multi-database environment management:
- **Zustand Store** with persistence (AsyncStorage)
- **Dynamic Client Switching** - Switch Supabase clients on the fly
- **Environment CRUD Operations:**
  - Add new environments (name, URL, key)
  - Remove environments (except production)
  - Switch between environments
  - Get active client
  - Reinitialize client
- **Automatic Rehydration** - Restores active environment on app restart
- **Connection Testing** - Verifies environment before switching

### 3. **Database Utilities** (`src/utils/databaseUtils.ts`)
Comprehensive testing and management functions:

**Data Generation:**
- `generateMockTasks(count)` - Create test tasks with [TEST] prefix
- `seedDatabase()` - Create sample projects and tasks

**Data Cleanup:**
- `cleanupMockTasks()` - Remove all [TEST] tasks
- `resetDatabase()` - Delete ALL data (tasks, projects, assignments)

**Testing & Monitoring:**
- `runComprehensiveTests()` - 7-test suite (connection, auth, queries, RLS)
- `checkDatabaseHealth()` - Get stats (users, projects, tasks, response time)
- `exportDatabaseData()` - Backup all data to JSON

### 4. **Updated Supabase Client** (`src/api/supabase.ts`)
Enhanced for dynamic environment switching:
- Added `setSupabaseClient()` function
- Added `getSupabaseClient()` function
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Supports environment hot-swapping

### 5. **Navigation Integration**
Updated navigation structure:

**`src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`:**
- Added `DevAdminScreen` import
- Added route to `AdminDashboardStack`
- Wired up navigation handler

**`src/screens/AdminDashboardScreen.tsx`:**
- Added `onNavigateToDevAdmin` prop
- Added "Dev Admin Tools" card (red, code icon)
- Only shows for admin users

### 6. **Documentation**
Created comprehensive guides:

**`DEV_ADMIN_GUIDE.md`** (Full Documentation):
- Complete feature overview
- Environment management guide
- Testing tools reference
- Creating testing database (step-by-step)
- Security best practices
- Testing workflows

9. Start testing!
```

### Common Operations:
```bash
# Generate test data
Dev Admin → Generate Mock Tasks

## ✅ Testing Checklist

Before using in production:

- [ ] Test environment switching works
- [ ] Verify all 6 testing tools execute without errors
- [ ] Confirm production warnings appear
- [ ] Check environment persistence across app restarts
- [ ] Validate confirmation dialogs prevent accidents
- [ ] Test with multiple environments added
- [ ] Verify health checks return accurate data
- [ ] Confirm mock tasks can be generated and cleaned up
- [ ] Test database reset (in testing environment only!)
- [ ] Ensure admin-only access works

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Environment limit**: No hard limit, but UI may get crowded with many environments
2. **Mock task limit**: Generate 50 at a time (run multiple times for more)
3. **Reset doesn't touch**: Users and Companies (only tasks/projects)
4. **No undo**: Destructive operations are permanent
5. **Single user**: Environment config is device-local, not synced

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check logs** - Console logs show detailed info
2. **Read docs** - DEV_ADMIN_GUIDE.md has troubleshooting
3. **Verify credentials** - Ensure URL and keys are correct
4. **Test connection** - Use Health Check to verify
5. **Fresh start** - Remove environment and re-add
