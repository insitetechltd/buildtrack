---

### D. Known Issues & Limitations

**Current Limitations:**

1. **No Backend:** All data local, no sync between devices
2. **No Real-time:** Changes don't propagate to other users
3. **Single Device:** Data tied to device, no cloud backup
4. **Limited Offline:** App works offline but no sync queue
5. **Photo Storage:** Photos stored as URIs, not uploaded to cloud
6. **No Search History:** Search doesn't save queries
7. **No Notifications:** No push notifications for updates

**Known Issues:**

1. **Hot Reload:** Metro bundler caches aggressively, requires device shake
2. **Large Images:** May cause memory issues if many uploaded
3. **Date Picker:** iOS only, Android needs platform-specific implementation
4. **Contact Picker:** Requires manual user selection, no search within picker

**Workarounds:**
- Hot Reload: Use `./force-reload.sh` then shake device
- Large Images: App compresses to 0.9 quality
- Date Picker: Works on iOS, Android fallback planned
- Contact Picker: Pre-filter users before showing picker
