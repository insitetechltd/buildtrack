# 🔧 Hot Reload Solution - Permanent Fix

## ⚠️ Root Cause Analysis

The metro bundler is caching JavaScript bundles and only rebuilding when it detects **significant** file changes. Small edits or timestamp changes are not triggering full rebuilds.

**Evidence:**
- Bundler logs show: `iOS Bundled 85ms index.ts (1 module)` - only 1 module bundled
- Should show: `iOS Bundled 28460ms index.ts (1351 modules)` - full rebuild

## ✅ Solution: Use the Force Reload Script

I've created `/home/user/workspace/force-reload.sh` that you can run after making changes.

### Usage:

```bash
cd /home/user/workspace
./force-reload.sh
```

This script:
1. ✅ Adds timestamp comments to force file detection
2. ✅ Touches all screen files
3. ✅ Touches translation files
4. ✅ Updates hot reload trigger
5. ✅ Clears metro cache
6. ✅ Sends reload signal to bundler

## 📱 Required: Device-Side Reload

**The bundler cannot force your device to reload.** You must:

### Method 1: Shake to Reload (Recommended)
1. **Physically shake your iPhone**
2. Menu appears with "Reload" button
3. Tap "Reload"
4. Wait 5-10 seconds

### Method 2: Force Close
1. Swipe up from bottom (or double-click home)
2. Swipe up on Expo Go to close completely
3. Reopen Expo Go
4. App reloads with new code

### Method 3: Dev Menu
1. In Expo Go, tap the ⋮ (three dots) menu
2. Tap "Reload"

## 🔄 Alternative: Restart Dev Server

If hot reload continues to fail, restart the entire dev server:

```bash
# Stop the server (Vibecode system will auto-restart)
sv stop expo

# Wait 5 seconds
sleep 5

# Start it again
sv start expo

# Wait for QR code to appear in logs
tail -f /var/log/expo/current
```

## 🎯 Why This Happens

Metro bundler has aggressive caching for performance:
- **Good**: Fast rebuilds during development
- **Bad**: Sometimes doesn't detect changes
- **Solution**: Manual device reload required

## ✨ What Changed This Session

**TasksScreen Updates:**
- ✅ Tab labels: "My Tasks" → "Task Inbox"
- ✅ Tab labels: "Assigned Tasks" → "Task Outbox"
- ✅ Empty state: Updated messages
- ✅ All font sizes increased significantly

**DashboardScreen Updates:**
- ✅ Section: "Tasks Assigned to Me" → "Task Inbox"
- ✅ Section: "Tasks I Assigned" → "Task Outbox"
- ✅ Project picker: Font size +3
- ✅ Stat cards: Horizontal scroll, 2 visible
- ✅ Recent tasks: Swipeable cards
- ✅ Task card fonts: All increased

**Translations:**
- ✅ English: "Task Inbox" / "Task Outbox"
- ✅ Chinese: "任務收件匣" / "任務寄件匣"

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

The code IS in the files. The issue is device-side caching. Try:

1. **Delete Expo Go app completely** from your device
2. **Reinstall Expo Go** from App Store
3. **Scan QR code** again
4. Changes should appear

**The code changes are saved and ready. The bundler is running. You just need to reload your device!** 📱✨
