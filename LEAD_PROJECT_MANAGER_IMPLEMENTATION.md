## üîß Technical Implementation

### **1. Project Store Enhancements**

Added three new helper functions to `projectStore`:

```typescript
// Get all projects where user is Lead PM
getUserLeadProjects: (userId: string) => Project[]

// Check if user is Lead PM for a specific project
isUserLeadPMForProject: (userId: string, projectId: string) => boolean

// Get the Lead PM user ID for a project
getLeadPMForProject: (projectId: string) => string | undefined
```

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
const leadProjects = getUserLeadProjects(user.id);
const isLeadPM = leadProjects.length > 0;
const leadProjectIds = new Set(leadProjects.map(p => p.id));
```

---

### **2. TasksScreen Changes**

**Before:** Users only saw tasks directly assigned to them  
**After:** Lead PMs see ALL tasks in their managed projects

**Implementation Logic:**
```typescript
const myParentTasks = tasks.filter(task => {
  // Lead PMs can see all tasks in their projects
  if (isLeadPM && leadProjectIds.has(task.projectId)) {
    return true; // Full visibility
  }
  
  // Regular users only see their assigned tasks
  return task.assignedTo.includes(user.id);
});
```

**Visual Indicator:**
```

```

### **3. ReportsScreen Changes**

**Same visibility logic as TasksScreen:**
- Lead PMs see all project tasks in reports
- Enhanced statistics for project-wide metrics
- Purple banner indicating Lead PM status

**Visual Indicator:**
```

```

### **4. UserManagementScreen Updates**

**Category Label:**
- Display: "Lead Project Manager"
- Color: Purple badge (`bg-purple-50 text-purple-600`)
- Order: First in the category list (most prominent)

## üîç How It Works (User Journey)

### **Scenario: John is Lead PM for Office Complex Project**

**Step 1: John logs in**
- System checks: `getUserLeadProjects("1")` ‚Üí Returns [proj-1, proj-2]
- Sets: `isLeadPM = true`
- Sets: `leadProjectIds = Set(['proj-1', 'proj-2'])`

**Step 2: John opens Tasks screen**
- TasksScreen detects: `isLeadPM = true`
- Applies special filtering:
  ```typescript
  tasks.filter(task => {
    if (leadProjectIds.has(task.projectId)) {
      return true; // Show ALL tasks in managed projects
    }
    return task.assignedTo.includes(user.id); // Regular logic
  });
  ```

**Step 3: John sees:**
- ‚≠ê Purple badge at top
- ALL tasks from proj-1 and proj-2
- Tasks assigned to Sarah, Lisa, and himself
- All subtasks (even deeply nested ones)

**Step 4: John opens Reports**
- Same logic applies
- Purple banner confirms Lead PM status
- Statistics cover entire project scope

## üìê Business Rules

### **Rule 1: One Lead PM Per Project (Recommended)**
While technically multiple Lead PMs can be assigned, it's recommended to have only one per project for clear accountability.

**Current Implementation:** Allows multiple Lead PMs  
**Future Enhancement:** Could add validation to enforce single Lead PM

### **Rule 2: Lead PM Sees Everything**
Lead PMs have complete visibility to:
- ‚úÖ All parent tasks
- ‚úÖ All subtasks (any nesting level)
- ‚úÖ Tasks assigned to anyone
- ‚úÖ Tasks created by anyone
- ‚úÖ All task updates and progress

### **Rule 3: Lead PM Cannot Bypass Assignment**
Even with full visibility, Lead PMs should still be assigned to projects:
- Required for project access
- Establishes formal responsibility
- Tracks project leadership

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Optional)

### **Possible Additions:**

1. **Lead PM Dashboard Tab**
   - Dedicated view for Lead PMs
   - Project-wide analytics
   - Team performance metrics

2. **Lead PM-Only Actions**
   - Approve/reject task completions
   - Reassign tasks between team members
   - View team member workload

3. **Lead PM Notifications**
   - Alerted when tasks are overdue
   - Notified of team member issues
   - Weekly project summary emails

4. **Single Lead PM Enforcement**
   - Validation: Only one Lead PM per project
   - Auto-suggest reassignment if adding second
   - Warning modal before reassignment

5. **Lead PM Handoff**
   - Structured process to transfer project leadership
   - Document transition responsibilities
   - Notify team of leadership change

---

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### **Q: Lead PM badge not showing?**
**A:** Check that user is assigned to a project with category "lead_project_manager"

```typescript
// Debug check:
const leadProjects = getUserLeadProjects(user.id);
console.log("Lead projects:", leadProjects); // Should return array
```

---

### **Q: Not seeing all tasks?**
**A:** Verify:
1. User is assigned as Lead PM (`category: "lead_project_manager"`)
2. Tasks belong to the project (`task.projectId` matches)
3. Assignment is active (`isActive: true`)

---

### **Q: Old label "Site Supervisor" still showing?**
**A:** Clear cache and restart:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.cache .expo
npx expo start --clear
```
