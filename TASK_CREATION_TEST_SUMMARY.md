  email: 'sarah@buildtrack.com',
  role: 'manager',
  company_id: 'company-123',
  position: 'Project Manager',
  phone: '+1-555-0100',
}
```

## What This Tests

### âœ… Task Store Functions Tested:
- `createTask()` - Creating new tasks
- `getTasksByUser()` - Querying user's tasks
- `acceptTask()` - Accepting assigned tasks

### âœ… Scenarios Covered:
1. **Sequential Creation** - Creating tasks one by one
2. **Assignment Logic** - Assigning tasks to specific user
3. **Batch Creation** - Creating multiple tasks at once
4. **Priority Handling** - Different priority levels
5. **Category Handling** - Different task categories
6. **Acceptance Flow** - User accepting tasks

### âœ… Edge Cases:
- Multiple assignments to same user
- Different task types (safety, electrical, structural)
- Different priority levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- Batch vs sequential creation

---

## Integration Points

### What's Mocked:
- âœ… Supabase database calls
- âœ… Task creation responses
- âœ… User data
- âœ… Project data

### What's Real:
- âœ… Zustand store logic
- âœ… Task assignment logic
- âœ… Query functions
- âœ… State management

---

## Example Output (Conceptual)

```
âœ… Successfully created 3 tasks
   Task 1: Safety Inspection - Week 1 (ID: task-1)
   Task 2: Electrical System Review (ID: task-2)
   Task 3: Structural Assessment (ID: task-3)
   All assigned to: Sarah Johnson (sarah-123)

âœ… Verified: Sarah has 3 tasks assigned
   1. Safety Inspection - Week 1 (high priority)
   2. Electrical System Review (medium priority)
   3. Structural Assessment (critical priority)

âœ… Created 3 tasks with different priorities:
   1. Low Priority Task - low
   2. Medium Priority Task - medium
   3. High Priority Task - high

âœ… Batch created 3 tasks for Sarah:
   1. Morning Safety Check (ID: task-batch-0)
   2. Equipment Inspection (ID: task-batch-1)
   3. Progress Report Review (ID: task-batch-2)

âœ… Task created and Sarah accepted it
   Task ID: task-accept-1
   Accepted by: Sarah Johnson
```

---

## Code Structure

### Test Organization
```typescript
describe('TaskStore - Create and Assign Tasks', () => {
  // Setup mock data
  const sarahUser = { ... };
  const testProject = { ... };
  const currentUser = { ... };

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Reset store and mocks
  });

  it('creates 3 tasks and assigns each to Sarah', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  // More tests...
});
```

### Key Features:
- âœ… Clean setup with `beforeEach()`
- âœ… Realistic mock data
- âœ… Comprehensive assertions
- âœ… Console logging for clarity
- âœ… Async/await properly handled
- âœ… Multiple test scenarios

---

## Test Assertions

### What Gets Verified:
```typescript
// Task IDs are truthy
expect(task1Id).toBeTruthy();
expect(task2Id).toBeTruthy();
expect(task3Id).toBeTruthy();

// Correct number of database calls
expect(insertCalls).toBe(3);

// Sarah has correct number of tasks
expect(sarahTasks).toHaveLength(3);

// Each task contains Sarah's ID
sarahTasks.forEach((task) => {
  expect(task.assignedTo).toContain(sarahUser.id);
});

// Task details are correct
expect(sarahTasks[0].title).toBe('Safety Inspection - Week 1');
expect(sarahTasks[0].category).toBe('safety');
expect(sarahTasks[0].priority).toBe('high');
```

---

## Next Steps

### Add More Tests:
1. **Test updating tasks** - Modify task details
2. **Test task delegation** - Reassign tasks
3. **Test task completion** - Mark tasks as done
4. **Test subtasks** - Create subtasks for main tasks
5. **Test filters** - Filter by status, priority, etc.

### Example:
```typescript
it('updates Sarah\'s task status to in_progress', async () => {
  // Create task
  // Update status
  // Verify change
});

it('delegates Sarah\'s task to another user', async () => {
  // Create task for Sarah
  // Delegate to John
  // Verify reassignment
});
```
