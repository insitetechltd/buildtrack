# Cross-Company Collaboration - Admin Feature

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Feature:** Admins can add users from any company to projects  
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

---

## 📋 Overview

Admins can now add users from **any company** to their projects, enabling true cross-company collaboration. This is essential for construction projects where multiple companies work together (e.g., General Contractors, Subcontractors, Suppliers, Consultants).

---

## ✨ What Changed

### Before
❌ Admins could only see and add users from their own company  
❌ No cross-company collaboration possible  
❌ Projects limited to single-company teams

### After
✅ Admins can see ALL users from ALL companies  
✅ Can add any user to any project  
✅ Enables multi-company project teams  
✅ Search across all companies  
✅ Clear company identification for each user

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

```
Project: Downtown Office Complex
Companies involved:
- ABC Construction (General Contractor) - Admin creates project

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- **`src/screens/ProjectDetailScreen.tsx`**

### Key Changes

#### 1. Import Additional Functions (Lines 23, 47, 49)
```typescript
import { useCompanyStore } from "../state/companyStore";

const { getUserById, getUsersByCompany, getAllUsers } = useUserStoreWithInit();
const { getCompanyById } = useCompanyStore();
```

#### 2. Updated AddMemberModal - Show All Users for Admins (Lines 795-824)
```typescript
// CHANGED: Admins can see ALL users from ALL companies
const allAvailableUsers = React.useMemo(() => {
  if (user?.role === "admin") {
    // Admin: Show ALL users from ALL companies
    return getAllUsers().filter(u => !existingMembers.includes(u.id));
  } else {
    // Non-admin: Show only users from same company (fallback)
    const companyUsers = user?.companyId ? getUsersByCompany(user.companyId) : [];
    return companyUsers.filter(u => !existingMembers.includes(u.id));
  }
}, [user?.role, user?.companyId, getAllUsers, getUsersByCompany, existingMembers]);

// Filter by search query (includes company name search)
const availableUsers = React.useMemo(() => {
  if (!searchQuery.trim()) {
    return allAvailableUsers;
  }
  
  const query = searchQuery.toLowerCase();
  return allAvailableUsers.filter(u => {
    const company = getCompanyById(u.companyId);
    return (
      u.name.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
      (u.email && u.email.toLowerCase().includes(query)) ||
      u.position.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
      (company && company.name.toLowerCase().includes(query))
    );
  });
}, [allAvailableUsers, searchQuery, getCompanyById]);
```

#### 3. Added Search Bar (Lines 879-907)
```typescript
{/* Search Bar */}
<View className="bg-white px-6 py-3 border-b border-gray-200">
  <View className="flex-row items-center bg-gray-100 rounded-lg px-3 py-2">
    <Ionicons name="search" size={20} color="#6b7280" />
    <TextInput
      placeholder="Search by name, email, position, or company..."
      value={searchQuery}
      onChangeText={setSearchQuery}
    />
    {searchQuery.length > 0 && (
      <Pressable onPress={() => setSearchQuery("")}>
        <Ionicons name="close-circle" />
      </Pressable>
    )}
  </View>
  
  {/* Results info */}
  {user?.role === "admin" && (
    <Text>
      {availableUsers.length} users available
      {' • '}Showing users from all companies
    </Text>
  )}
</View>
```

#### 4. Enhanced User Cards - Show Company Info (Lines 935-962)
```typescript
<View className="flex-1">
  <Text className="text-base font-medium">{availableUser.name}</Text>
  
  {/* Position and Role */}
  <View className="flex-row items-center mt-1">
    <Text>{availableUser.position}</Text>
    <Text>{availableUser.role}</Text>
  </View>
  
  {/* Company name - important for cross-company visibility */}
  {userCompany && (
    <View className="flex-row items-center mt-1">
      <Ionicons name="business-outline" size={12} />
      <Text className="text-xs text-gray-500 ml-1">
        {userCompany.name}
      </Text>
    </View>
  )}
  
  {/* Email */}
  {availableUser.email && (
    <Text className="text-xs">{availableUser.email}</Text>
  )}
</View>
```

#### 5. Updated Empty States (Lines 980-1007)
- Different messages for search results vs. no available users
- Admin-specific messaging indicating "all companies"

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Company Isolation Still Maintained
While admins can **add** users from other companies, the following company isolation rules still apply:

✅ **What's Shared:**
- User profiles (name, position, email)
- Project assignments
- Task assignments
- Project-level data

❌ **What's NOT Shared:**
- Company internal data
- Other projects from other companies
- User management (can't edit other company's users)
- Company-specific settings

### Data Privacy
- Users from other companies only become visible when assigned to a project
- Personal data is limited to what's needed for collaboration
- Company-sensitive information remains private
- Each company still manages its own users

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Possible Improvements
1. **Company Grouping** - Group users by company in the list
2. **Company Filters** - Quick filter to show users from specific companies
3. **Invitation System** - Invite companies to join project, then add their users
4. **Company Permissions** - More granular control over what other companies can see
5. **Activity Tracking** - Log when users from other companies are added
6. **Bulk Operations** - Add all users from a company at once

## 🎓 Developer Notes

### Code Organization
```typescript
// User filtering logic
if (user?.role === "admin") {
  // Show ALL users
  return getAllUsers().filter(...);

}
```

### Key Functions Used
- `getAllUsers()` - Get all users from all companies
- `getUsersByCompany(id)` - Get users from specific company
- `getCompanyById(id)` - Get company details for display

### State Management
```typescript
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");  // Search state
const allAvailableUsers = useMemo(...)  // All users (filtered by existing members)
const availableUsers = useMemo(...)     // Filtered by search query
```
