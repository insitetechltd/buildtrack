                    │   │
                    │   └─→ < 5MB? ──→ Done! ✅
                    │
                    └─→ Upload compressed image
```

### Adaptive Quality Algorithm

The compression service tries these steps in order:

1. **Check dimensions** - If > 1920px, resize proportionally
2. **Initial compression** - Apply 80% quality
3. **Size check** - Is it under 5MB?
   - ✅ Yes → Upload
   - ❌ No → Continue
4. **Quality reduction** - Try 65% quality
5. **Size check** - Is it under 5MB?
   - ✅ Yes → Upload
   - ❌ No → Continue
6. **Further reduction** - Try 50% quality
7. **Continue** until < 5MB or minimum quality (30%) reached
8. **Last resort** - Aggressive dimension reduction (70% of original)

## 💻 Implementation

### 1. Image Compression Service

**File:** `src/api/imageCompressionService.ts`

This service handles all compression logic:

```typescript
import { compressImage, compressImages } from '@/api/imageCompressionService';

// Compress a single image
const result = await compressImage(imageUri, 5 * 1024 * 1024); // 5MB target

console.log('Compressed:', {
  originalSize: result.originalSize,
  newSize: result.size,
  savings: `${((1 - result.compressionRatio) * 100).toFixed(1)}%`
});

// Compress multiple images
const results = await compressImages(imageUris, 5 * 1024 * 1024);
```

**Key Functions:**

- `compressImage(uri, targetSize)` - Compress single image
- `compressImages(uris, targetSize)` - Compress multiple images
- `needsCompression(uri, targetSize)` - Check if compression needed
- `estimateCompression(uri)` - Estimate result without compressing
- `formatFileSize(bytes)` - Format size for display

### 2. Upload Hook with Compression

**File:** `src/utils/useFileUpload.ts`

The hook automatically compresses before uploading:

```typescript
const { 
  pickAndUploadImages, 
  isCompressing, 
  compressionProgress 
} = useFileUpload();

// This automatically compresses images before upload
const files = await pickAndUploadImages({
  entityType: 'task',
  entityId: taskId,
  companyId: currentUser.company_id,
  userId: currentUser.id,
}, 'camera'); // or 'library'
```

### 3. UI Integration

Show compression progress to users:

```typescript
import { useFileUpload } from '@/utils/useFileUpload';

function MyUploadScreen() {
  const { 
    pickAndUploadImages, 
    isCompressing, 
    compressionProgress,
    isUploading,
    uploadProgress 
  } = useFileUpload();

  return (
    <View>
      {isCompressing && (
        <View>
          <Text>Compressing images...</Text>
          <ProgressBar progress={compressionProgress} />
        </View>
      )}
      
      {isUploading && (
        <View>
          <Text>Uploading...</Text>
          <ProgressBar progress={uploadProgress} />
        </View>
      )}
      
      <Button 
        onPress={handleUpload}
        disabled={isCompressing || isUploading}
      >
        Upload Photos
      </Button>
    </View>
  );
}
```

| 80% | Initial try | Excellent | Large | ✅ Yes |
| 65% | If needed | Very Good | Medium | ✅ Yes |
| 50% | If needed | Good | Small | ⚠️ Maybe |
| 30% | Last resort | Acceptable | Very Small | ⚠️ Rare |

### What You'll Notice

**80-100% Quality:**
- Virtually identical to original
- No visible compression artifacts
- Excellent for all use cases

**50-80% Quality:**
- Minor differences in detail
- Still looks professional
- Good for most construction photos

**30-50% Quality:**
- Noticeable compression
- Some detail loss
- Acceptable for reference photos
- Rarely needed with dimension reduction

---

## 📐 Dimension Limits

### Maximum Dimensions

```
Max Width:  1920 pixels
Max Height: 1920 pixels
```

### Why These Limits?

1. **Display Size** - Most phones are < 1920px wide
2. **File Size** - Larger dimensions = larger files
3. **Performance** - Faster loading and rendering
4. **Storage** - More efficient storage usage

### Aspect Ratio Preserved

The compression maintains the original aspect ratio:

```
Original: 4032 x 3024 (4:3 ratio)
Resized:  1920 x 1440 (4:3 ratio) ✅

Original: 3264 x 1836 (16:9 ratio)
Resized:  1920 x 1080 (16:9 ratio) ✅
```

## ⚡ Performance

### Compression Speed

| Original Size | Time to Compress | Device |
|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| 15 MB | 2-3 seconds | iPhone 12 |
| 10 MB | 1-2 seconds | iPhone 12 |
| 5 MB | < 1 second | iPhone 12 |
| 15 MB | 3-4 seconds | Android mid-range |
| 10 MB | 2-3 seconds | Android mid-range |

### Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Processing** - Multiple images compressed in parallel
2. **Memory Management** - Deletes intermediate files
3. **Progress Feedback** - Shows user what's happening
4. **Early Exit** - Skips compression if already small enough

---

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Current Settings

```typescript
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB
const MAX_IMAGE_WIDTH = 1920;
const MAX_IMAGE_HEIGHT = 1920;
const INITIAL_QUALITY = 0.8; // 80%
const MIN_QUALITY = 0.3; // 30%
```

### Customization

If you want different limits, edit `src/api/imageCompressionService.ts`:

```typescript
// For smaller target (better for slower networks)
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 3 * 1024 * 1024; // 3MB

// For higher quality (if you have more storage)
const INITIAL_QUALITY = 0.9; // 90%

// For smaller dimensions (faster processing)
const MAX_IMAGE_WIDTH = 1280;
const MAX_IMAGE_HEIGHT = 1280;
```

## 📊 Storage Savings

### Example Calculations

**Without Compression:**
```
100 photos × 12MB average = 1,200 MB (1.2 GB)
Exceeds free tier! ⚠️
```

**With Compression:**
```
100 photos × 4MB average = 400 MB
Well within free tier! ✅
```

### Bandwidth Savings

**Without Compression:**
```
User uploads 10 photos × 12MB = 120 MB upload
Another user views them = 120 MB download
Total bandwidth: 240 MB per exchange
```

**With Compression:**
```
User uploads 10 photos × 4MB = 40 MB upload
Another user views them = 40 MB download
Total bandwidth: 80 MB per exchange
```

**Savings:** 67% less bandwidth! 🎉

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Image still too large after compression"

**Rare, but possible solutions:**

1. **Check original size** - Is it extremely large (>50MB)?
2. **Try fewer images** - Upload one at a time
3. **Manual resize** - Use phone's built-in editor first
4. **Contact support** - May need to adjust limits

### "Compression taking too long"

**Normal for:**
- Very large images (>20MB)
- Multiple images at once
- Older/slower devices

**Solutions:**
- Upload fewer images at once
- Wait patiently (usually < 5 seconds per image)
- Close other apps to free memory

### "Image quality too low"

**Check:**
- Original image size (was it huge?)
- Quality setting in `imageCompressionService.ts`
- Try uploading smaller original images

---

## 🔬 Technical Details

### JPEG Compression

- **Format:** Always outputs JPEG (even if PNG input)
- **Why JPEG:** Better compression for photos
- **Color Space:** RGB
- **Metadata:** Preserved when possible

### expo-image-manipulator

Uses Expo's native image manipulation:
- **iOS:** Uses Core Image framework
- **Android:** Uses Android Bitmap API
- **Performance:** Hardware-accelerated
- **Quality:** Professional-grade compression

### Memory Management

```typescript
// After each compression attempt, cleanup
try {
  await FileSystem.deleteAsync(previousUri, { idempotent: true });
} catch (e) {
  // Ignore errors
}
```

This prevents memory buildup when trying multiple quality levels.

## 🎓 FAQ

**Q: Why not compress on the server?**  
A: Client-side compression saves bandwidth and is faster. User pays their data plan, not server bandwidth.

**Q: Will users notice the quality loss?**  
A: Rarely. At 80% quality, compression is virtually invisible. Even at 65%, most people can't tell.

**Q: What about PNG images?**  
A: They're converted to JPEG. PNG is inefficient for photos. Transparency is lost, but construction photos rarely need it.

**Q: Can users opt out of compression?**  
A: Not currently. Compression ensures the app works well for everyone, especially on slower networks.

**Q: What if compression fails?**  
A: The image is skipped and user is notified. They can try again or contact support.

**Q: Does this work offline?**  
A: Compression works offline. Upload requires internet.

**Q: What about videos?**  
A: Videos aren't compressed. They have a 50MB hard limit. Consider using video hosting services for large videos.
